			<h3>Too Much Time Spent on a Process</h3>
				<p>Is your marketing person spending nearly half their day just entering data 
				into spreadsheets instead of creating great new marketing content? Then thatâ€™s a
				good reason to find automated solutions.

				<h3>Staff Error reduction </h3>
				<p>
					Are mistakes costing your company thousands of dollars each year? Do you have
					processes where failure means extra costs and negative impacts on your company?

					Automation reduces the chance of human error because every task is completed the
					exact same way every time, just as it was programmed, ensuring a consistently accurate process.
