				<h1> About Me !</h1>
				<p> I have worked at EIT for roughly four years, progressing from the internship program to becoming a full fledged member of the support team. During this time, I’ve gained hands on experience in networking, Microsoft Cloud suite, and customer support. I also developed several applications independently while completing my Bachelor of Computing.

				Troubleshooting is one of the strongest links between programming and IT operations. Effective problem solving requires a structured, step by step approach whether that means researching solutions, revisiting old notes, or applying persistence and analytical thinking to work through complex issues.
