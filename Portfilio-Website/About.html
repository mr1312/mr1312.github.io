				<h1> About Me !</h1>
				<p> I've Interned at the Eastern Institute of Techology IT services from them I learned alot about networking, ticketing systems and customer service
				all the applications created were done in my own time as I studied to complete my Bachelor of Computing. 
				<br>
				One link between programming and IT roles is troublshoting as to figure out the solution it requires a step by step approuch often using google 
				or desperately finding old notes if these fail then problem solving and a stuborn refusal to give up will have to do. 
				<br>
				As for extra activities I like watching Joe Rogan and World of Warcraft 
				</p>
