					Digital Transformation is a phrase that businesses have been talking about for a long-time. Many businesses
					recognise the benefits that digitisation brings, but have problems keeping momentum in deploying solutions.
					The main problem has always been the cost involved in developing software, which is often bespoke to each organisation.

					The Covid-19 pandemic of 2020 has led to more and more businesses committing to speeding up their digital transformation
					plans. This is largely driven from the need for efficiency to maintain growth and, in some instances, to survive.

					Automation, whichever flavour you choose, offers so many benefits and with economies struggling, following the recent
					Covid-19 pandemic, it really is a case of ‘survival of the fittest’. Companies that come out on top will be those that
					have adapted to change becoming more agile, cost-efficient, and offer better customer and employee satisfaction. All of
					which can be addressed by the adoption of automation systems developed using Low-Code platforms.
