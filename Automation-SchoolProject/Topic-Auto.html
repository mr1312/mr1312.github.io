			<li> <p>Top Advantages of Industrial Automation
					Automationâ€™s key advantage is increasing productivity in facilities. Labor reduction, repeatability, waste reduction,
					enhanced quality control, and integration with existing business systems give companies an advantage by reducing 
					long-term costs, which increases product output and revenue. Disadvantages include high initial costs in purchasing 
					technology and increases in maintenance costs.
					
					For decades, automation has been used in industry to produce simple objects. However, the combination of computers and
					existing technology in the mid-20th century allowed more complex tasks to be completed in much faster times.

					Automation can also be used in the testing of software applications through a process called test automation. In this process,
					computers are programmed with special scripts, usually computer programs, to run the same tests on software that a human would
					have to do manually. Test automation provides many of the same advantages as industrial automation including labor reduction, 
					repeatability, and waste reduction.
