			<li><p> Digital Automation is an alternative to traditional automation approaches like Application Programme Interfaces’ (APIs). The technology accesses systems using the user interface of applications enabling rapid ‘virtual’ integration to 
			 autonomously execute business processes with human exception management. </p>

		<h3>Automation benefit to all  industry examples:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Manufacturing, including food and pharmaceutical, chemical and petroleum, pulp and paper</li>
				<li>Transportation, including automotive, aerospace, and rail</li>
				<li>Utilities, including water and wastewater, oil and gas, electric power, and telecommunications Defense</li>
				<li>Facility operations, including security, environmental control, energy management, safety, and other building automation And many others</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>	
			<br>
			<h2>Why automation is important </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Think about the cell phone and computer you use every day to do your job. Think about the car you drive to take to work. Think about the food you eat;
				water you drink; clothes you wear; and appliances you use to store, prepare, and clean them. Think about the television you watch, video games you play, 
				or music system you listen to.   
				</li>

				<br>
				<li>
					Think about the buildings you visit. Think about any modern convenience or necessity. Just about anything you can think 
				of is the result of complex processes. Without talented individuals to design, build, improve, and maintain these processes, these technological advances
				would never have occurred and future innovations would be impossible. Without automation professionals, our world and our future would be very different.
